# Local OCR

A local, privacy-focused desktop application that converts PDFs and images to
structured Markdown using Vision-Language models served by
[Ollama](https://ollama.com). Nothing leaves your machine or network: the app
talks only to the Ollama server URL you configure.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10 or newer with Tkinter support (macOS, Linux, or Windows).
  Both Tk 8.6 and Tk 9.0 work with the pinned customtkinter version
  (customtkinter 6.x; older 5.2.x renders blank windows under Tk 9.0 on
  macOS).
- A running Ollama server — locally or reachable on your network. The app
  never starts, installs, or pulls anything itself.
- A vision-capable model installed on that server.

## Installation

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate        # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

```bash
python main.py
```

## Setting up Ollama

The app requires an Ollama server that is already running. To see which
models a server has installed:

```bash
ollama list
```

To install a vision-capable model:

```bash
ollama pull <model-tag>
```

The model suggestions shown in the app (`gemma4:12b`, `qwen3.6:27b`) are
examples only — they are not guaranteed to exist on your server and are never
pulled automatically. Use `Refresh Models` to list what your server actually
has, or type any model tag manually.

### Server URL

- Local Ollama: keep the default `http://localhost:11434`.
- Ollama on another machine: use its address, e.g.
  `http://192.168.1.50:11434`.

**Network safety:** exposing Ollama beyond localhost makes it reachable by
anyone who can connect to that port. Only bind it to a trusted network and
protect it with your firewall; Ollama has no built-in authentication.

## Usage

1. `Select File` — choose one PDF or image (`.pdf`, `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`,
   `.webp`).
2. Confirm the server URL, pick or type a model tag, and choose a PDF DPI
   (100/150/200/300; higher is sharper but slower — DPI only affects PDFs).
3. `Start OCR`. Progress appears in the log; each PDF page is rendered and
   sent to the model in order.

### Output

The result is saved as UTF-8 Markdown **next to the input file** with the
`_extracted.md` suffix — `/docs/report.pdf` becomes
`/docs/report_extracted.md`. If that file already exists you are asked before
it is overwritten; declining leaves it untouched. The file is written
atomically, so a failed run never leaves a partial result.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause and fix |
| --- | --- |
| `connection refused` | Ollama is not running, or the URL/port is wrong. Start Ollama (`ollama serve` or the desktop app) and verify the URL. |
| Timeout | Server unreachable (wrong LAN address, firewall) or the model is too slow for the page. Try a smaller model or lower DPI. |
| `model not found` | The tag is not installed on that server. Check `ollama list` and `ollama pull <tag>` on the server. Models are never pulled automatically. |
| Empty or garbage output / "returned no text" | The selected model has no vision support. Choose a vision-capable model. |
